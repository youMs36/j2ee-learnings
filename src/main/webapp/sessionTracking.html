HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol <br>
Its a Stateless protocol. 
- Stateless means, when user sends second request. Server does not know/ tracks the who sent the request. 
- each request received to server will be treated a new request.
- EXAMPLE-  first request :: a login Request. if user successfully logins and then again tries to login, 
- then its expected that server should identify that user has already logged in. 
- Hence web app developer must track session in servlet.
this concept is called state management OR session tracking.
-----------------------------------------------
What are the session tracking techniques?

1. Cookies
2. Hidden Form Field
3. URL Rewriting
4. HttpSession
---------------------------------------------------

<h2>Cookie object</h2>
Cookie is a 
- a small amount of information sent by a servlet to a Web browser, saved by the browser, and later sent back to the server.
- The servlet sends cookies to the browser by using the HttpServletResponse#addCookie method
- Cookies can be retrieved from a request by using the HttpServletRequest#getCookies method. Several cookies might have the same name but different path attributes.
- How much cookie size is supported by browsers?
--The browser is expected to support 20 cookies for each Web server, 300 cookies total, and may limit cookie size to 4 KB each.
- cookie value CAN NOT  have space. Only one string literal is accepted as a cookie value.
-----------------------------<br>
<h3> how to use cookies in Servlet? </h3>
1. Cookie class in package - javax.servlet.http
2. Server sends cookie in the response object.
<code>
Cookie ckObject = new Cookie("key", "value");
response.addCookie(ckObject);
</code>
3. How to read cookies from request object?
<code>
Cookies[] ckArray = request.getCookies(); //returns an array.
if(null == ckArrray)
{
	new request for a web server
}
else
{
	current request is not new. server has already interacted with user from whom the request is received.
}
